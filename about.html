          Hello, My name is Miles and I am a developer & infrastructure enthusiast keen on the best practices in DevOps.<br><br>
          I am a senior at The University of Kentucky studying Information Communication Technology with a minor in Digital Media & Design. On top of this, I am an IT helpdesk technician which gives me new problems to solve every single day. My true passion, however, is in the development & infrastructure of cloud-based services, an area I find both challenging and engaging. Getting to work with and understand new technologies is incredibly fulfilling to me and has inspired me to continually keep learning throughout my future in IT.<br><br>
          When Iâ€™m not studying, at the helpdesk, or developing personal projects, you can find me reading, running, or exploring a museum.<br><br>
          After university, I plan to pursue a career in information technology with the ultimate goal of becoming a cloud-focused developer and system operator.
